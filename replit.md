# Management System - Replit Migration

## Project Overview
A comprehensive management system with features for attendance tracking, inventory management, employee management, payroll, orders, invoices, and analytics. Successfully migrated from Bolt to Replit environment with transition from Supabase to Neon PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM.

## Current State
- **Status**: Migration in progress
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **Architecture**: Full-stack application with client/server separation

## Recent Changes

### 2025-01-17 - Database Migration
- ✅ Created comprehensive Drizzle schema with all tables (users, stores, attendance, products, orders, tasks, payroll, messages, activity_logs, invoices)
- ✅ Implemented DatabaseStorage class with full CRUD operations
- ✅ Successfully pushed database schema to Neon PostgreSQL
- ✅ Created comprehensive API routes for all entities
- ✅ Implemented authentication system to replace Supabase auth
- ✅ Added proper error handling and validation with Zod schemas

### Database Schema
The system includes the following main entities:
- **Users**: Employee and admin management with role-based access
- **Stores**: Multi-location store management
- **Attendance**: Check-in/check-out tracking with status
- **Products**: Inventory management with stock tracking
- **Orders**: Customer order processing with items
- **Tasks**: Task assignment and tracking
- **Payroll**: Salary and bonus management
- **Messages**: Internal communication system
- **Activity Logs**: Audit trail for all actions
- **Invoices**: Invoice generation and management

### API Endpoints
Comprehensive REST API with endpoints for:
- User management (CRUD operations)
- Store management
- Attendance tracking
- Product inventory
- Order processing
- Task management
- Payroll operations
- Messaging system
- Activity logging
- Invoice management
- Authentication (login/register)

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React components with TypeScript, using Wouter for routing
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT-like session management (replacing Supabase)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui components

## User Preferences
- Security-focused: Client/server separation maintained
- Performance-oriented: Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Type-safe: Full TypeScript implementation with Zod validation
- Scalable: Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps
1. Complete Supabase code removal from client-side
2. Update frontend components to use new authentication system
3. Test all API endpoints and frontend integration
4. Verify deployment readiness
